## Executive Summary

This analysis examined weekly health supplement sales from **January 2020 through December 2024** across multiple platforms (Amazon, Walmart, iHerb) and regions (USA, UK, Canada). The project aimed to uncover trends in product performance, regional demand, and platform effectiveness, while identifying key factors driving sales and returns.

**Key Insights:**
- Strong year-over-year sales growth
- Distinct seasonal purchasing patterns
- Notable differences in platform and regional performance
- Opportunities to optimize pricing, promotions, and inventory allocation

## Business Problem

Supplement sales are distributed across various platforms and geographic markets, making it difficult to track performance consistently and identify which products, regions, or channels are most profitable. Additionally, return rates are not fully understood. Without a unified analysis, strategic decisions around inventory, promotions, and platform focus remain reactive rather than data-driven.

**Core Challenges:**
- Fragmented sales data across Amazon, Walmart, and iHerb
- Inconsistent regional performance metrics
- Unclear return rate drivers across product categories
- Seasonal revenue fluctuations without proactive planning
